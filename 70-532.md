## Create and manage Virtual machines 
Easily creatable in the Portal and can also be automated. 

Difference between managed and unmanaged disks is either Azure manages (the managed option) them for you and you do not see a new storage account showing in the list of your resources, or you manage them yourself by creating them and assigning that storage account to your VM upon creation (unamanged option). When the VM is initialized, a VHD will be created within that storage account as a page blog for hosting the OS.<>

When you create a VM you get:
- Network interface component (NIC)
- Public IP pointing to NIC
- Virtual network wrapping the VM and the NIC
- Network security group for the VM
- Disk (Virtual hard drive, VHD) containing the OS

You can either add multiple disks to a VM directly, and map them in the OS, or you can shut down the VM and increase the size of the current disk (max size depends on VM type, 1-4TB). 

If you need to share a disk between multiple VMs you need a storage account of the standard, and create SMB file shares you can map to your VMs.
