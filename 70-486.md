[Improving Your MVC Applications with 10 Extension Points](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/mvc-applications-10-extension-points-improving).

## Action Results
Action results are custom result types which extend `ActionResult` you can implement. You implement your own logic in the ExecuteResult override method.
```csharp
public class XMLResult : ActionResult
{
    private object _data;
    
    public XMLResult(object data)
    {
        _data = data;
    }

    public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)
    {
        XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(_data.GetType());
        var response = context.HttpContext.Response;
        response.ContentType = "text/xml";
        serializer.Serialize(response.Output, _data);
    }
}
```

## Action Filters
**Controllers implement IActionFilter which is run around every action within the controller.** If you return a Result on the filterContext (for example a redirect) you can short-circuit the pipeline. If no Result is set, the execution goes on to the next filter or the action itself.

```csharp
public interface IActionFilter {
    // called before action is executed
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext);

    // called after action is executed
    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext);
}
```
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
## HTML Helpers

You can create inline helpers for simple view logic, or more complex ones by implementing static methods returning MvcHtmlString or similar return types.
```html
@helper Button(string label)
{
    <button>@label</button>
}
```

```csharp
public static MvcHtmlString Button(this HtmlHelper html, string label) 
{
    var btn = new TagBuilder("button");
    btn.SetInnerText(label);
    return new MvcHtmlString(btn.ToString());
}
```

## View Engines
You can create your own view engine by implemeting `IViewEngine`, but often times it is better to extend an already existing view engine.
```csharp
public class ThemeViewEngine: RazorViewEngine 
{
    public ThemeViewEngine(string themeName)
    {
        // override default ViewLocationFormats
        ViewLocationFormats = new string[]
        {
            "~/Views/" + themeName + "/{1}/{0}.cshtml", 
            "~/Views/" + themeName + "/Shared/{0}.cshtml"
        };

        // override default PartialViewLocationFormats
        PartialViewLocationFormats = new string[]
        {
            "~/Views/" + themeName + "/{1}/{0}.cshtml",
            "~/Views/" + themeName + "/Shared/{0}.cshtml"
        };
    }
}
```
To enable a view engine in your application you must register it (often in global.asax):
```csharp
ViewEngines.Engines.Insert(0, new ThemeViewEngine(themeName));
```
View engines run in order, in this case if the `ThemeViewEngine` is unable to find a fitting razor template, it will default to the standard view engine in the `Engines` collection.

## Exception filters
You can have none, one, or several exception filters on a single action, controller or registered globally in your application.
```csharp
public class LoggingExceptionFilter : FilterAttribute, IExceptionFilter
    {
        public void OnException(ExceptionContext filterContext)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Exception was thrown");

            filterContext.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 500;
            // To indicate the exception was handled, set value to true. Filters up the chain will still be called so make sure to check for ExceptionHandled upstream
            filterContext.ExceptionHandled = true;
        }
    }
```

To add an exception filter globally you have to register it in the global filters collection. You can also use them as attributes on controllers and actions.
```csharp
GlobalFilters.Filters.Add(new HandleErrorAttribute());
```

## Validation

Good fit for simple validation, separation of concerns.

```csharp
public class CustomValidator : ValidationAttribute
    {

        public ValueMustBeValidator()
        {
            ErrorMessage = "Your error message";
        }

        public override bool IsValid(object value);
    }
```
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Good fit if you need cross viewmodel property validation.
```csharp
public class ViewModel : IValidatableObject
{
    public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext);
}
```

## Model binders

Binds the model values incoming to the type specified.
```csharp
public CustomModelBinder : IModelBinder {
    public object BindModel(ControllerContext cc, ModelBindingContext bc);
}
```

Returns a model binder if it finds one that is registered as appropriate. Return null for no binder appropriate.
```csharp
public CustomModelBinderProvider : IModelBinderProvider {
    public IModelBinder GetBinder(Type modelType){
        // You can access HttpContext and read Content-Type to return ModelBinder
    }
}
```
To use a custom ModelBinderProvider you need to register it with (in global.asax or something similar):
```csharp
ModelBinderProviders.BinderProviders.Insert(0, new CustomModelBinderProvider());
```

You can use a ModelBinder directly without having a provider by decorating the viewmodel class with the attribute:
```csharp
[ModelBinder(typeof(YourModelBinder))]
public class ViewModel {}
```
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
## Custom value providers
These components can provide additional data to the model binder. For example pick out header values and add them to the model binding context.

```csharp
public interface IValueProvider {
    // property name is prefix, can you provide it?
    bool ContainsPrefix(string prefix);

    // if you can, we will call GetValue for it
    ValueProviderResult GetValue(string key);
}
```

Every provider needs a factory, where you creat it out of a ControllerContext and register the factory in Global.asax. In this factory, you can determine what part(s) of the HttpContext gets passed in to your ValueProvider.

```csharp
ValueProviderFactories.Factories.Insert(0, new YourValueProviderFactory());
```

Only the first value provider which can provide the value will be called, no other ones down the queue in the ValueProviderFactories.

## Authentication and authorization filters
If you need the user to be identified before access and do not care too much about who the user is, or what role, use authentication. If you need control such as only certain roles etc can access a resouce, use authorization.

Authentication is checked before authorization.

```csharp
public interface IAuthenticationFilter {
    // used to authenticate a request and establish identity of user
    void OnAuthentication(AuthenticationContext filterContext);

    // runs when request has failed to authenticate and right after action method execution
    void OnAuthenticationChallenge(AuthenticationChallengeContext filterContext);
}
```
In general avoid to implement this interface directly, but rather inherit from the AuthorizeAttribute. It has support for override where needed, and handles the tricky parts for you.
```csharp
public interface IAuthorizationFilter 
{
    // check roles, scopes etc
    void OnAuthorization(AuthorizationContext filterContext);
}
```
To stop execution of further Filters down the road, you must return a filterContext.Result. If this value is null, the next filter is evaluated.

## Action Name Selectors and Action Method Selectors
Allow you to customize the descision making progress for which action will be used to handle the request. 

```csharp
// Example of Action name selector
[ActionName("Home")]
public IActionResult Index()

// Example of Action method selector
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult About()

[HttpPost]
public IActionResult About()
```

Order of execution is:
1. Action name selection
2. Action method selection
3. 404 if no match
4. ambigous error if multiple match with same selector rank
5. select highest rank or single returned action

```csharp
public class CustomNameSelector: ActionNameSelectorAttribute 
{
    public override bool IsValidName(
        ControllerContext controllerContext, 
        string actionName, 
        MethodInfo methodInfo
    );
}

public class CustomMethodSelector: ActionMethodSelectorAttribute 
{
    public override bool IsValidForRequest(
        ControllerContext controllerContext,
        MethodInfo methodInfo
    );
}
```

If any of the applied action selectors return false, the action is no longer regarded as an option for the incoming request.
